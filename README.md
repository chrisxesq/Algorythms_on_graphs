### reachibility:
Given an undirected graph and two distinct vertices u and v, check if there's a path between u and v

### scc:
Check whether a given directed graph with n vertices and m edges contains a cycle

### topological:
Compute a topological ordering of a given directed graph with n vertices and m edges

### w3:
Given an undirected graph with n vertices and m edges u and v, compute the length of a shortest path between u and v

### dijkstra:
Given an directed graph with positive edge weights and with n vertices and m edges as well as two vertices u and v, compute the shortest path between u and v

### neg_cycle:
Given an diirected graph with possibly negative edge weights with n vertices and m edges, check whether it contains a cycle of negative weight

### mst:
Given 𝑛 points on a plane, connect them with segments of minimum total length such that there is a path between any two points. Recall that the length of a segment with endpoints (𝑥1, 𝑦1) and (𝑥2, 𝑦2) is equal to √︀ (𝑥1 − 𝑥2) ^2 + (𝑦1 − 𝑦2)^ 2
